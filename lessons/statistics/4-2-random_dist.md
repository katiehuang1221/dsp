[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
The numbers generated by ```random.random``` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from ```random.random``` and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

Generate 1000 random numbers:
```
numbers = np.random.random(1000)
```

Plot their PMF:
```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(numbers)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number',ylabel='PMF')
```

Plot their CDF:
```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(numbers)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number',ylabel='CDF')
```
