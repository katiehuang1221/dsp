[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)
Use the NSFG respondent variable ```NUMKDHH``` to construct the actual distribution for the number of children under 18 in the household.
Now compute the biased distribution we would see if we surveyed the children and asked them how many children under 18 (including themselves) are in their household.
Plot the actual and biased distributions, and compute their means.
